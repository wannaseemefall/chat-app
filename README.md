## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* MongoDB installed locally or a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas account.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd wannaseemefall/chat-app/chat-app-f6552d5119d34dced10a5f878d90c52b79940fa0
    ```

2.  **Server Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following content:
        ```
        MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
        JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
        PORT=5001 # Optional, default is 5001
        ```
        * Replace placeholders with your actual MongoDB connection string, a strong JWT secret, and Cloudinary API credentials.
    * Start the server:
        ```bash
        npm run server
        # Or for production: npm start
        ```
        The server will run on `http://localhost:5001` (or your specified PORT).

3.  **Client Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `client` directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following content:
        ```
        VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5001" # Or your deployed backend URL
        ```
    * Start the development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The client application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).
